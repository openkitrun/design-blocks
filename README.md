  Build your mobile applications React Native with blocks
</h1>

An open source library with tools for creating dynamic user interfaces for applications written in React Native, focused on the developer experience.

You can use these components as the base layer of your design system or adopt them incrementally.

## Documentation

For detailed information and usage instructions, visit our [official documentation](https://designblocks.dev). (Work in Progress)

## Installation

To integrate Design Blocks into your project, you can install the package using your preferred package manager. Choose one of the following commands:

```sh
// with pnpm
pnpm add @design-blocks/native

// with yarn
yarn add @design-blocks/native

// with npm
npm add @design-blocks/native

// with bun
bun add @design-blocks/native
```

## Configuring Design Blocks

### Creating Your Configuration File

To configure Design Blocks, create a blocks.config.ts file (.js works too) and import `createBlocks` and `createTokens` functions from `@design-blocks/native`.

```ts
// blocks.config.ts
import { createTokens, createBlocks } from "@design-blocks/native";
```

The `createTokens` function receives a configuration object:

- theme: defines the tokens for your theme, mapping to CSS properties and style props.
- utils: creates custom utilities to enhance your development experience.

And returns an array with the following:

- theme: at position 0 of the array is the theme with tokens generated by `createTokens`.
- utils: at position 1 of the array are the utils generated by `createTokens`.

The `createBlocks` function receives a configuration object:

- theme: receives the tokens generated by `createTokens`.
- themes: or it can receive an object with multiple themes generated by `createTokens`.

And returns all the available functions:

- block: Facilitates creating styled React-Native components.
- theme: The `theme` object is passed to the `ThemeProvider`, easing style management and accessibility.
- themes: The `themes` object is passed to the `ThemeProvider`, allowing the use of multiple themes.
- utils: Create custom utils to improve your developer experience.
- css: Facilitates string interpolation for writing CSS in a readable manner.

```ts
// blocks.config.ts

import { createTokens, createBlocks } from "@design-blocks/native";

const [themeTokens] = createTokens({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        text: {
          primary: "#000",
          secondary: "#fff",
        },
        red: {
          100: "#FFEEEE",
          200: "#FACDCD",
          ...
        },
      },
    },
    extendTokens: {
      spacings: {
        "7xl": 76,
      },
      radii: {
        "6xl": 32,
      },
      fontSizes: {
        "10xl": 80,
      },
    },
  },
  utils: {
    toPixels: (value: number) => `${value}px`,
    ...
  },
});

export const { block, css, theme, themes } = createBlocks({
  theme: themeTokens,
});
```

### Using Your Configuration File

From this point onwards, you'll be importing block and other functions from blocks.config.

```tsx
// App.tsx index root application react-native

import React from "react";

import RootNavigator from "./RootNavigation";

import { ThemeProvider } from "@design-blocks/native";

import { theme } from "./blocks.config";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <RootNavigator />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```tsx
import { block } from "[path-to]/blocks.config";

const Description = block.Text(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.colors.violet[400],
  fontSize: 30,
}));
```
